# Long-runs
> The surprising predictability of long runs in a sequence

<b>Lottery, roulette, coin tossing, digits of pseudorandom numbers</b> - turns out that
these, at first sight totally incomparable and unpredictable sequences, have one
thing in common - they all are <i>quite predictable</i>.<br><br><br>

Turns out, that we can predict
very accurately the longest run in all these sequences - and quite easily. The
model described in this paper is very 
exible - it can fit to any of these sequences
of any length and any success probability (if it's a sequence of independent
Bernoulli trials). We also provide an example of Florida Pick 2 Midday Lottery
for better understanding of the model.
